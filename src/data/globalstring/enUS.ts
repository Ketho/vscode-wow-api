	VOICEMACRO_20_Hu_5: String.raw`So, I have this idea for a great movie.  It's about two Gnomes who find a bracelet of power, and they have to take it to the Burning Steppes and cast it into The Cauldron.  They form the Brotherhood of the Bracelet.  Along the way, they're trailed by a murloc named Gottom who's obsessed with the bracelet, and nine bracelet bogeymen.  It could be a three parter called "Ruler of the Bracelet".  The first part would be called "The Brotherhood of the Bracelet", followed by "A Couple of Towers", with the climactic ending called "Hey, the King's Back".`,
	VOICEMACRO_20_Hu_5_FEMALE: String.raw`I can't find anywhere to get my nails done.`,

	VOICEMACRO_20_Ni_3_FEMALE: String.raw`I think that guys just use the Emerald Dream as an excuse to avoid calling me back.`,
	VOICEMACRO_20_Ni_4: String.raw`I don't know about you, but I can't understand a thing those Wisps say.  I usually just nod.`,
	VOICEMACRO_20_Ni_4_FEMALE: String.raw`Oh, I'm dancing again.  I hope all your friends are enjoying the show.`,
	VOICEMACRO_20_Ni_5: String.raw`Who wants to live forever?`,
